**Readme File: Project Overview**

**Objective:**
This project, part of MDS504 Applied Machine Learning, seeks to reinforce learning modules by demonstrating comprehensive coding skills in Python. Emphasizing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, it involves experimenting with various algorithms, parameters, and settings to construct an optimal machine learning model.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Designing comprehensive machine learning models using libraries and toolkits.
- Applying Python for data loading, transformation, and algorithmic implementation.
- Evaluating models for practical solutions to real-world problems.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
The project will be assessed based on:

- Well-commented Jupyter Notebook facilitating understanding.
- Extensive use of Python libraries and toolkits.
- Appropriate data loading, preparation, and transformation.
- Production of an accurate machine learning model.
- Proper tuning of the machine learning model.
- Presentation of performance evaluation with suitable indicators.

**Requirements:**

1. Load a dataset into Jupyter Notebook.
2. Utilize Python libraries and toolkits for data preparation and transformation.
3. Train a suitable machine learning algorithm.
4. Choose a domain (Transportation, Service Business, Retail, Education, Healthcare, or Manufacturing).
5. Select a dataset from the chosen industry with a sufficient number of observations (more than 1000).
6. Briefly describe all features within the dataset (engineering and/or raw features).
7. Explore the dataset, including visualization.
8. Discuss the model's performance using a validation dataset.
9. Evaluate the model based on three suitable performance indicators, surpassing general threshold values.
